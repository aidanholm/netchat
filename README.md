# Chat #

### Description ###

This is a very basic chat application that I wrote in a very short time for a Computer Networks class assignment. Both client and server are written in C; the client uses an ncurses interface. The chat system itself is similar to IRC, except there are no named channels; instead you simply start a chat with other people on the server.

I am still tidying this project up, and there are plenty of areas with room for improvement.
